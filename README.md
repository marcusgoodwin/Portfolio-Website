# Portfolio-Website
This is a website that I have built for my portfolio. I used place holder images for the three smaller website cards, as I don't have anything to display there. This was a lot of fun to learn how to do, and I'm very excited to build upon this website. For the future I plan to add some JavaScript and make it more interactable. Please leave me some suggestions on things that I can implement or change in this Website! Thank you!
